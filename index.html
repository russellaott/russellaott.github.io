        <h2>The Lives of Party Animals</h2>
            <p>As you can see based on the breakdown of each party animal species, they all have their own lifestyle choices. Some of them seem to be happier than others or more successful. Regardless of how we see them from the outside looking in, they all have a special place on this planet we call earth. They are all various pieces of the puzzle and we appreciate the role they each play in our lives. I know personally that without a beagle that can play keyboard my life would not seem complete. Others may say that the dancing frog is their true spirit animal. </p>
